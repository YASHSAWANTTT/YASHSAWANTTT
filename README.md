# Hey, I’m Yash Sawant

**Software Engineer | AI Systems | Real-Time & Data Platforms**  
MS + BS Computer Science @ Arizona State University

I build **AI-powered, data-heavy products that real users depend on** spanning full-stack web, distributed systems, and agent-based AI. I care deeply about **performance, correctness, and user trust**, especially when AI sits directly inside core workflows.

Previously shipped production systems at **Zoom (Next Lab)**, built NSF-funded education platforms, and developed AI products used by hundreds of users.

## How I Like to Work

- I move fast, but I don’t ship things I wouldn’t trust myself
- I care about systems that **explain themselves**, especially when AI is involved
- I’m comfortable jumping across frontend, backend, infra, and AI in the same day
- I do my best work in **early-stage, high-ownership environments**
